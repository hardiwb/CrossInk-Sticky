# Sticky Notes extension

This folder contains the optional, receive-only Sticky Notes extension. It is
kept separate from the reader activities so a personal fork can carry or drop
the feature with minimal merge conflicts. Define
`CROSSINK_ENABLE_STICKY_NOTES=0` in the PlatformIO build flags to remove its
menu entry and activity.

The complete list of fork-owned files, upstream integration points, persistent
settings, and update procedure is maintained in the
[fork delta guide](../../../docs/crossink-sticky-fork-delta.md).

Opening **Menu > Sticky Notes** immediately starts Wi-Fi station mode and
ESP-NOW on channel 1 for 60 seconds. The normal deep-sleep path is unchanged and
never listens for notes. If listening times out, select **Receive Note** to try
again.

## Sender protocol

Any ESP32 firmware can act as the sender; BrokenSignal-Pro is not required. See
the [standalone sender protocol guide](../../../docs/sticky-notes-esp-now-sender.md)
for the checklist text format, packet and ACK layouts, and retry behavior.

Send unencrypted ESP-NOW on Wi-Fi channel 1. All multi-byte values are
little-endian. The table below is the legacy v1 format for notes up to 220 bytes.
Updated senders can transfer up to 2048 bytes using v2 numbered chunks; see the
standalone guide above for the 24-byte header, CRC, and retry contract.

| Offset | Bytes | Value |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 4 | ASCII `CINT` |
| 4 | 1 | Protocol version: `1` |
| 5 | 1 | Packet type: `1` (note) |
| 6 | 1 | Reserved: `0` |
| 7 | 1 | UTF-8 message length, 1-220 bytes |
| 8 | 4 | Non-zero sender sequence number |
| 12 | 2 | Year, 2024-2099 |
| 14 | 1 | Month, 1-12 |
| 15 | 1 | Day, valid for the month |
| 16 | N | UTF-8 message bytes, without a trailing NUL |

The Xteink validates the whole packet before changing storage. Line feeds split
checklist rows; carriage returns and tabs are rendered as spaces. After a
successful render and settings save, it sends a 16-byte acknowledgement to the
source MAC using the same header:
packet type `2` at offset 5 and the received sequence number at offset 8.

The sender should transmit every 250-500 ms until it receives the matching
acknowledgement or its own timeout expires. Increment the sequence number for
each new note.

For v2, repeat the complete chunk sequence at 100 ms intervals until the final
save ACK (version 2), with a 30-second sender timeout. The receiver does not
touch the old image until all chunks pass date, size, CRC and UTF-8 checks.
The activity holds one 2060-byte Note and small assembly metadata, replacing
the previous pair of 232-byte Note members and avoiding full-message locals.
The receiver repeats final ACKs for two seconds so packet loss does not force
another render/save. Original v1 senders still work.
SD-card fonts use an optional 2090-byte prewarm scratch allocation for the
activity lifetime, replacing a growing render-time string. Allocation failure
falls back to the built-in font; no second framebuffer is allocated.

The output remains one image. Long transfers use compact card spacing and a
More indicator for remaining rows; wrapped row text can still be ellipsized.
Each validated message is also retained by date under
`/.crosspoint/calendar/YYYY-MM-DD.bin`. Sending the same date again atomically
replaces that day's entry. Calendar layout marks every retained day in the
displayed month; the selected day's rows remain subject to the available
screen space.

The generated 1-bit bitmap is installed atomically at
`/.sleep/sticky-note.bmp`, selected as the favorite custom sleep image, and
picked up by the firmware's existing sleep-screen scanner on the next sleep.
Choose **Settings > Reader > Font Options > Sticky Notes Layout > Calendar**
to put a Monday-first month grid above the received note rows. The received
date is highlighted with a light-gray rounded marker. The default Classic
layout remains unchanged.
