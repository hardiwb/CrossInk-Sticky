# Build a Sticky Notes sender

Any ESP32 firmware can send a Sticky Notes sleep screen to CrossInk-Sticky;
BrokenSignal-Pro is not required.

## Receiver workflow

1. On the Xteink, open **Menu > Sticky Notes > Receive Note**.
2. The Xteink listens on ESP-NOW channel 1 for 60 seconds.
3. Broadcast the note packet described below.
4. Wait for the Xteink ACK.

There is no persistent pairing and no shared encryption key. The receiver runs
only from the Receive Note screen, so normal deep sleep is not interrupted.

## Text format

Encode one checklist item per UTF-8 line:

```text
[ ] Buy groceries
[ ] Call Alice
[x] Archive invoices
```

- The entire text must be 1-2048 UTF-8 bytes. Count bytes, not characters.
- Use v1 for messages up to 220 bytes; use the chunked v2 format below for larger messages.
- Separate items with one `LF` byte (`0x0A`, `\n`).
- Do not add `LF` or NUL after the final item.
- Prefix an unfinished item with the exact four bytes `[ ] `.
- Prefix a completed item with the exact four bytes `[x] ` (lowercase `x`).
- Replace CR, LF, or tab inside an item's text with a normal space.
- Do not include the date in the text; encode it in the packet header.

A sender may omit completed items to produce an active-tasks-only note.
Ordinary UTF-8 is accepted, but these prefixes and row separators produce the
intended checklist layout.

## Version 1 note packet (legacy)

Use unencrypted ESP-NOW on Wi-Fi channel 1. The packet is exactly
`16 + messageLength` bytes. Multi-byte integers are unsigned little-endian.

| Offset | Size | Value |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 4 | ASCII `CINT` (`43 49 4E 54`) |
| 4 | 1 | Protocol version `1` |
| 5 | 1 | Packet type `1` (note) |
| 6 | 1 | Reserved `0` |
| 7 | 1 | UTF-8 message length, `1`-`220` |
| 8 | 4 | Non-zero sequence number |
| 12 | 2 | Year, `2024`-`2099` |
| 14 | 1 | Month, `1`-`12` |
| 15 | 1 | Valid day for the month and year |
| 16 | N | Exactly N UTF-8 message bytes, without NUL |

Build the header byte-by-byte instead of relying on a packed struct. For
example, encode a 32-bit sequence number as:

```cpp
packet[8]  = sequence;
packet[9]  = sequence >> 8;
packet[10] = sequence >> 16;
packet[11] = sequence >> 24;
```

The receiver rejects a mismatched packet length, zero sequence, invalid date,
malformed UTF-8, embedded NUL, or unsupported control characters. It preserves
`LF` as a row separator and normalizes CR and tab to spaces.

## Version 2 chunked note packets

Keep the magic, packet type, sequence, and date offsets from v1. Byte 4 is `2`,
byte 6 is the zero-based chunk index, and byte 7 is this chunk's byte length.
Append this extension instead of placing text at offset 16:

| Offset | Size | Value |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 16 | 2 | Total message bytes, 1-2048 |
| 18 | 1 | Chunk count: ceil(total / 220), maximum 10 |
| 19 | 1 | Reserved zero |
| 20 | 4 | CRC-32/ISO-HDLC of the entire raw UTF-8 message |
| 24 | N | Payload: 220 bytes except the last chunk |

All integers are little-endian. CRC uses reflected polynomial `0xEDB88320`,
initial value `0xFFFFFFFF`, and final XOR `0xFFFFFFFF`. Each packet is exactly
`24 + N` bytes, at most 244 bytes. All chunks carry identical sequence, date,
total, count and CRC fields. UTF-8 characters may cross chunk boundaries.

Send chunks in a repeating cycle at 100 ms intervals until the final ACK, with
a 30-second sender timeout. There is no per-chunk ACK. The receiver accepts
out-of-order and identical duplicate chunks, ignores other source MACs and
sequences during assembly, and releases an incomplete transfer after five
seconds without an accepted packet. Invalid lengths, offsets, dates, CRC or
full-message UTF-8 never trigger a render/save. CRC is not authentication.

The receiver uses one activity-owned 2 KB buffer, not a full-message stack
temporary. Callbacks copy only one small packet into a mailbox; the activity
loop handles reassembly, validation, rendering and storage.

## ACK packet

After rendering and saving succeeds, the Xteink sends this 16-byte unicast
packet to the sender's source MAC:

| Offset | Size | Value |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| 0 | 4 | ASCII `CINT` |
| 4 | 1 | Protocol version copied from the note (`1` or `2`) |
| 5 | 1 | Packet type `2` (ACK) |
| 6 | 1 | Reserved `0` |
| 7 | 1 | Message length `0` |
| 8 | 4 | Sequence number copied from the note |
| 12 | 4 | Reserved zeros |

An ESP-NOW send callback confirms only radio delivery. Report success only when
a valid ACK contains the sequence number and version of the note being sent.
The receiver repeats the final ACK every 350 ms for two seconds before exiting,
without rendering or saving duplicate packets again.

## Radio and retry requirements

- Use `WIFI_STA`, set channel 1, and initialize unencrypted ESP-NOW.
- Add `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF` as an unencrypted broadcast peer on channel 1.
- Register the receive callback before transmitting.
- Use a new random non-zero sequence for each new note.
- For v1, retry the unchanged packet every 250-500 ms until its ACK arrives.
- For v2, cycle all chunks every 100 ms; stop only on the final save ACK.
- Allow up to 30 seconds for reception, rendering and storage before timing out.
- Restore the sender's previous Wi-Fi state/channel when finished.

Repeated packets carrying the same sequence and content are retries, not new
notes. ESP-NOW callback signatures differ between Arduino-ESP32 2.x and 3.x;
use the signatures required by the sender project's installed core.

## Compatibility and display limits

Both devices must be updated to send more than 220 bytes. Old senders remain
supported, and the updated BrokenSignal sender uses v1 for small notes. Old
receivers ignore v2 and will not acknowledge a larger transfer.

Each accepted transfer is an upsert for its header date. CrossInk stores the
complete validated text under `/.crosspoint/calendar/`; resending the same date
atomically replaces that day. No protocol change is required for calendar
storage. In Calendar layout, stored dates in the displayed month receive a dot
and the most recently received date is selected.

The lock screen remains a single image, not a paginated notebook. Larger
messages use tighter card spacing. Text can be ellipsized within a row, and
**More** indicates remaining rows below the screen. The 2 KB transfer allowance
does not guarantee that every row fits at the selected font size, but the full
validated message remains in its dated calendar file.

## Verification

In the adjacent BrokenSignal-Pro repository, run `tools/test_sticky_chunks.ps1`
with a host g++ compiler. It checks identical protocol headers and exercises
both copies for legacy compatibility, 2 KB roundtrips, packet loss/reordering,
duplicates, CRC/UTF-8 failures, invalid headers, sender isolation and timeouts.
After flashing both devices, test a 221-2048 byte day through Receive Note.
Interrupt a transfer and confirm the existing sleep image is preserved; then
retry normally and verify the dated image and final sender acknowledgement.
